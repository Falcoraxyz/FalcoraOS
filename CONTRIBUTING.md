## 🛡️ Branch Protection & Workflow

We have protected the `main` branch to ensure stability. Here is how you can contribute:

1.  **Fork** the repository to your own GitHub account.
2.  **Clone** your fork to your local machine.
3.  **Create a Branch** for your feature or fix:
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature
    ```
4.  **Commit** your changes with clear messages.
5.  **Push** to your fork.
6.  **Open a Pull Request (PR)** to the `main` branch of this repository.

> **Note:** Direct pushes to `main` are disabled. All changes must go through a Pull Request and require review.

## 🧪 Testing

Please ensure your changes do not break existing functionality. Run the app locally to verify:
```bash
npm start
```

## 🎨 Code Style

-   Keep code clean and commented where necessary.
-   Follow the existing project structure.
